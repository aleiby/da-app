While existing uploads persist, service may degrade over time.\n\n## Current State\n- Using `nft.storage` npm package for uploads in `src/admin.ts`\n- Card images stored at CID: `bafybeiefg5nl5ioy37lrzizqxmb4woadptwjjegtarv2nfqohxzitsd4be`\n- URIs stored as `ipfs://` protocol (good - gateway-agnostic)\n\n## Research Needed\n1. Test existing CID accessibility and latency across gateways\n2. Evaluate alternatives for new uploads:\n   - Pinata (NFT-focused, popular)\n   - Filebase (S3-compatible)\n   - NFT.Storage Long-Term Storage (one-time fee via Lighthouse)\n   - Arweave (permanent storage, different model)\n3. Determine where gateway URLs are resolved (likely Unity client)\n4.

It may be outdated.\n\n## Current State (as of 2026-01)\n- Contracts deployed to Ghostnet using **legacy SmartPy IDE** (legacy.smartpy.io/ide)\n- SmartPy CLI doesn't support ARM64 (WSL2 on ARM Windows)\n- New SmartPy IDE (smartpy.io/ide) requires different module syntax (`@sp.module` decorator, etc.)\n- Our contracts use legacy syntax (`sp.for`, `sp.if`) which we partially updated but still need the legacy IDE\n\n## Questions to Answer\n\n### Standards\n- What is the current state of TZIP-12 (FA2)?\n- Is there an FA2.1 or newer standard? What does it add?\n- Are there other relevant TZIPs for NFTs (metadata, royalties, etc.)?\n\n### Reference Implementations\n- What is the current canonical FA2 template from SmartPy?\n- Are there other well-maintained FA2 implementations to consider?\n- What security audits or bug fixes have been applied?\n\n### Smart Contract Language Choice\n- **SmartPy**: Python-based, familiar, but significant syntax changes between versions\n- **Ligo**: OCaml/ReasonML-like, popular in Tezos ecosystem\n- **Archetype**: Domain-specific language for Tezos, formal verification support\n- **Michelson**: Low-level but direct, no compilation step\n- Which has best tooling, documentation, community support in 2026?\n\n### Features to Evaluate\n- On-chain royalties (TZIP-24?)\n- Improved metadata standards (TZIP-21?)\n- Gas optimizations in newer implementations\n- Compatibility with major marketplaces (objkt, etc.)\n\n### Migration Path\n- Can we upgrade without breaking existing tokens?\n- What would migration involve?\n- If switching languages, what's the effort to reimplement?\n\n## Resources\n- https://gitlab.com/tzip/tzip (TZIP specifications)\n- https://smartpy.io/templates/fa2_lib.py (current SmartPy FA2 library)\n- https://legacy.smartpy.io/ide (legacy SmartPy IDE - works with current contracts)\n- https://docs.tezos.com/ (official docs)\n- https://ligolang.org/ (Ligo language)\n- https://archetype-lang.org/ (Archetype language)","status":"open","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-10T18:26:02.770960928-08:00","created_by":"aleiby","updated_at":"2026-01-10T18:48:34.353039223-08:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"da-app-8z0","depends_on_id":"da-app-ke2","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-10T18:26:03.544269255-08:00","created_by":"aleiby"}]}

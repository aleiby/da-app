Useful when testing fresh game sessions or debugging. Implementation: Create scripts/reset-dev-state.sh that: (1) Flushes all Redis keys (redis-cli FLUSHALL), (2) Optionally clears MongoDB test collections (if using local MongoDB), (3) Preserves production data (check NODE_ENV), (4) Confirms before destructive operations.

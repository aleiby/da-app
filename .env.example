# Digital Arcana Environment Variables
#
# This file documents all environment variables used in production.
# For development, use the private/ directory with local config files instead.
#
# Copy this file to .env (not tracked by git) if you want to use environment
# variables for local development instead of the private/ directory approach.

# Environment mode
# Set to "production" for production deployments
# Set to "development" or leave unset for development mode
NODE_ENV=production

# Server port
# Default: 3001 (changed from 8080 to avoid conflict with Gas Town dashboard)
# Note: Vite dev server uses 3000, backend server uses 3001
PORT=3001

# Redis connection URL (Production)
# This variable name is specific to Qovery deployment platform
# For other platforms, adjust the variable name and connection string format
# Format: redis://[username:password@]host:port[/database]
QOVERY_REDIS_Z8BD2191C_DATABASE_URL=redis://localhost:6379

# MongoDB connection string (Production)
# Format: mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/database?retryWrites=true&w=majority
# Get this from MongoDB Atlas dashboard
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/digitalarcana?retryWrites=true&w=majority

# Tezos signer private key (Production)
# This is the private key used to sign transactions (pack purchases, NFT transfers)
# Should correspond to an account with operator permissions on the FA2 contract
# Format: edsk... (Tezos secret key)
# IMPORTANT: Keep this secure! Never commit to version control.
SIGNER_KEY=edsk...

# NFT.storage API key (Production)
# Used for uploading card images to IPFS when minting new sets
# Get this from https://nft.storage/ dashboard

NFT_STORAGE_API_KEY=eyJ...

# Note: The current codebase reads NFT.storage key from private/storageKeys.js
# in development mode. You may need to update src/admin.ts to read from
# environment variable in production if NFT_STORAGE_API_KEY is set.
